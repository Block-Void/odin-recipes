        </p>


        <!-- Ingredients -->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Steps -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the
                eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to 
                combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high 
                heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 
                1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that 
                the batter coats the surface evenly. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. 
                Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.
